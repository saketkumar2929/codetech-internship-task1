# codetech-internship-task1
This project focuses on developing a complete data pipeline to automate the process of data preprocessing, transformation, and loading (ETL). Using powerful Python libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn, the pipeline reads raw data, handles missing values, scales numerical features, and outputs clean, ready-to-use data for further analysis or modeling.
